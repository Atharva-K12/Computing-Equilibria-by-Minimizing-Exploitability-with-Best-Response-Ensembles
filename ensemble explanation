The given excerpt is describing a method called "exploitability descent with best-response ensembles (BRE)" for finding an optimal strategy in a game. Here, the aim is to minimize the exploitability of a strategy profile. Exploitability is defined as the maximum expected gain of an opponent against a given strategy profile, minus the gain of the player using that strategy profile.

To minimize the exploitability, the authors propose to update the strategy profile iteratively by finding the gradient of the exploitability with respect to each player's strategy, and then moving in the opposite direction of the gradient. Specifically, the authors suggest updating the strategy profile as follows:

    Let x be the current strategy profile of all players, where x-i is the strategy of all players except player i.
    For each player i, compute the maximum expected gain of all responses j by their opponents, denoted by maxj u(yij , x-i)i.
    Compute the exploitability of player i as the difference between the maximum expected gain of the opponent and the gain of player i, i.e., (maxj u(yij , x-i)i - u(x)i).
    Compute the gradient of the exploitability with respect to player i's strategy, ∇x ∑i∈I (maxj u(yij , x-i)i − u(x)i), and update player i's strategy in the opposite direction of the gradient, i.e., x = x - η∇x ∑i∈I (maxj u(yij , x-i)i − u(x)i), where η is the learning rate.
    For each player i, compute the expected gain of all responses j by their opponents, denoted by mixj u(yij , x-i)i.
    Compute the exploitability gradient for each response yij, i.e., ∇y ∑i∈I (mixj u(yij , x-i)i − u(x)i), and update the response yij in the direction of the gradient, i.e., yij = yij + η∇y ∑i∈I (mixj u(yij , x-i)i − u(x)i).

The authors note that the above computations can be done in parallel for all players and responses, making the algorithm efficient. The code for this algorithm is provided in the appendix.
